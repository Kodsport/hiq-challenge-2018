\noindent
In the USA, a type of dance called \emph{square dance} is very popular.
Four dancing pairs stand as to form a square.
A \emph{caller} then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor.

American wizards, however, find square dancing a bit simplistic.
Instead, they have come up with a kind of dance called \emph{circle dancing}.
In the dance, $N$ wizards stand in a circle numbered $1$ through $N$ clockwise.
A caller then gives a series of moves that the dancers should perform, moving around on the floor.
Each such move has the following form.
Every wizard is given a number $p_i$.
They then all teleport simultaneously $p_i$ positions clockwise or counterclockwise in the ring.
For example, given the number 1 they should move to one of the two places immediately adjacent to their current position.

After a move is performed, no two wizards may occupy the same position.
This means a certain amount of coordination is required when teleporting.
Can you tell the wizards how they should teleport in order to not collide with each other?

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 300\,000$), the number of wizards.
The next line contains the $N$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_N$ ($0 \le p_i < N$).
The wizards are numbered $1, 2, \dots, N$ clockwise in the circle.

\section*{Output}
Output a string with $N$ characters.
The $i$'th character should be \texttt{L} if the $i$'th wizard should teleport clockwise, and \texttt{R} if he should teleport counterclockwise.
If there are multiple valid solutions, output the \emph{lexicographically smallest one}.
If there is no valid solution, output \texttt{no dance}.
