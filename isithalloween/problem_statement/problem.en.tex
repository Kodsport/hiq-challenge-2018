\noindent
HiQ recently got an assignment from a client to create a clone of the immensely popular website \url{IsItHalloween.com}.
The website is a very simple one.
People will visit the site occasionally to see if it is halloween.
Whenever it is, the website should print out \texttt{yup}, otherwise it should print out \texttt{nope} on the screen.

Since HiQ is such a popular firm, they don't have time to complete this assignment right now.
Their frontend engineers have already programmed the frontend of the website that prints out \texttt{yup} or \texttt{nope}, but not the backend microservice that determines whether it is indeed halloween or not.
Do you have time to help them?

The behaviour of the server should be as follows: it gets as input the current date in the format \texttt{FEB 9}, where \texttt{FEB} is the month given in three letters (\texttt{JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC}) and \texttt{9} is the day of the month starting at 1.
It should then determine if this date represents October 31 or December 25 (since $31_8 = 25_{10}$).

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single line containing a date of the format \texttt{FEB 9}, with the month and date separated by a single space.

\section*{Output}
If the date is October 31 or December 25, output \texttt{yup}.
Otherwise, output \texttt{nope}.
